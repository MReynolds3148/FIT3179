                    With technological improvements making travel consistently easier and cheaper, and wealth disparities
                    creating a bigger and bigger divide between classes, forcing some people to turn to smuggling and
                    illegal trafficking to survive and prosper.
                    <br><br>
                    Although the globe is more peaceful than ever, wars still rage and altercations still occur daily.
                    This creates a demand for weapons, espcially small arms, which often are more easily and quickly obtained
                    through less-than-legal suppliers, especially for countries with strong firearm laws.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout history people have also been treated as a commodity for the wealthy, being used as servants or
                    slaves. This trend appears to have continued into the modern age, as human trafficking is still a large issue.
                </p>

            <div class="pure-u-2-24"></div>
            <div class="pure-u-11-24">
                <p>
                    When illegal firearms are seized or human trafficking victims are rescued, the occurence is often reported to
                    the United Nations. The UN makes this data open-source, and tracks parameters such as location, what the outcome
                    of raids were, and victim nationality. The currently available data contains information from 2010-2020 for
                    firearm seizure, and 2007-2017 for human trafficking rescues. This report aims to compare the amount of incidents
                    between different countries and regions for these issues over the 10 year period. 
                    <br><br>
                    It must be noted that this report makes no conclusions about the relative safety of different countries based on
                    this data, as instances must be reported to the UN for tracking. A country may not disclose all this information,
                    and so smuggling rates may be higher than they appear. Also, a country with stricter laws and more resources will
                    be able to make more successful raids, leading to an apparent increase relative to countries with less resources
                    and less means of controlling dangerous imports.

                 Potentially due to Australia's strict firearm laws, we seem to have a disproportionate
                 amount of firearms smuggled across the border. With <strong style="color:lightcoral">
                 over 24,000 weapons seized, Australia</strong> has almost twice the ratio of illegally
                 imported firearms than the next highest, <strong style="color:lightcoral">Greece, with
                 13,000 weapons per 100,000 people.</strong>

                 While reknowned for their love of guns, the <strong style="color:lightcoral">United States
                 </strong>seized only <strong style="color:lightcoral">1500 firearms per 100k people</strong>, reflecting that it is much easier and cheaper
                 for them to obtain weapons legally.
